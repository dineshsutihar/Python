# Django create a new project

```bash
django-admin startproject project_name
```

After creating the project, you can see the following files and directories:

```bash
project_name/
    manage.py
    project_name/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
```

Use of each file and directory:

- `manage.py`: used to manage the project and perform tasks such as creating a new application, running the development server, and running tests.
- `project_name/`: the directory that contains the project.
- `__init__.py`: an empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
- `settings.py`: contains the settings for the project.
- `urls.py`: contains the URL patterns for the project.
- `asgi.py`: an entry point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve the project.
- `wsgi.py`: an entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve the project.
- `db.sqlite3`: the default database for the project.

## Run the development server

```bash   
python manage.py runserver
```

## Create a new application
### Why create a new application? and what is an application? in Django?..
- An application is a web application that does something â€“ e.g., a weblog system, a database of public records or a simple poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.
- Eg: Google has a project called "Google Search" and it has multiple applications like "Google Maps", "Google Images", "Google News", etc.

### How to create a new application?
```bash
python manage.py startapp app_name
```
- Now we have created a new application, you can see the following files and directories:
```bash
app_name/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py
```

Use of each file and directory:

- `__init__.py`: an empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
- `admin.py`: used to register the models of the application with the Django admin application.
- `apps.py`: contains the configuration of the application.
- `migrations/`: contains the database migrations for the application.
- `models.py`: contains the models of the application.
- `tests.py`: contains the tests for the application.
- `views.py`: contains the views of the application.

### Add the application to INSTALLED_APPS
1.  To add the application to the project, you need to add the application to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the `settings.py` file of the project.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'app_name', # add the application to the INSTALLED_APPS list
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]
```
2. Now you need to create a URL pattern for the application in the `urls.py` file of the project.

```python
from django.urls import include

urlpatterns = [
    path('app_name/', include('app_name.urls')), # add the URL pattern for the application
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```
3. Now you need to create a URL pattern for the application in the `urls.py` file of the application.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'), # add the URL pattern for the application
]
```
4. Now you need to create a view for the application in the `views.py` file of the application.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the app_name index.")
```
